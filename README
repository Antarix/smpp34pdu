smpp34pdu is an erlang library for the SMPP 3.4 wire protocol

Brief History
--------------
This library is a take two of a ad-hoc implementation of just
the wire protocol packing and unpacking routines. It is inspired
in part by OSERL's approach and my desire to implement this from
first principles after the lessons learnt implementing this in an
ad-hoc style.

Another goal of this library is to be fully tested and deemed 
"trustworthy".

The hidden goal of this library is to allow serve as boiler plate on
my research into binary protocol compiler compilers, which is one of
my current areas of interest.

I currently choose to support SMPP 3.4 since its the most widely deployed
variant of the protocol currently, and SMPP is designed to be backwardly
compatible, so any compliant system speaking SMPP 5 will accept and work
with SMPP 3.4 systems.

Building
--------
smpp34pdu is built with rebar, the awesome erlang build tool.

There is a Makefile wrapping up its use, so it plays nice with other
build environments.

First clone the sources from git hub:

   $ git clone git://github.com/essiene/smpp34pdu.git

Then build:
   $ cd smpp34pdu
   $ make

To run the unittests:
   $ make tests

To run dialyzer analysis:
   $ make analyze


Installation
------------
Deploy like any other erlang library


Tutorial
--------

This library just offers two functions: 
	1. Packing 
	2. Unpacking

The packing and unpacking use an internal representation which
are normal erlang records, thus allowing them to be used in pattern
matching clauses enabling more flexible use cases, than proplists.

Pictorially this looks like:

	BINARY PDU 
		-> smpp34pdu:unpack/1  
							-> 
								INTERNAL REPRESENTATION
							<-
		<- smpp34pdu:pack/2
	BINARY PDU

An example snippet is:

	BinaryPdu = <<0,0,0,37,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,
				  97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,
				  106,0,97,98,99,100,0,0,52,2,1,0>>,

	{ok, [InternalRep], <<>>} = smpp34pdu:unpack(BinaryPdu),

	%% InternalRep now contains the following record
	%%       #bind_receiver{
	%%				system_id="abcdefghij", 
	%%				password="abcd", system_type="", 
	%%				interface_version=?VERSION, addr_ton=2, 
	%%				addr_npi=1,address_range=""}
	%%

	BinaryPdu = smpp34pdu:pack(1, InternalRep).

	%% The preceeding should match properly, as InternalRep will
	%% be packed back into the same binary as BinaryPdu contains.
