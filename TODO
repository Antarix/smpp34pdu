- pdu.hrl should be renamed to smpp34pdu.hrl for easier usage

- Have a specific type for SMPP types with two values like 0 or 17
- We need to have a representation for DataTime values according to the spec
- Define helper constants for all parameters have an enumeration in the spec

- The spec says if ms_availability_status field is not set in alert_notification
  PDU, the ESME should regard the status as AVAILABLE. Should I go ahead and
  make this convenience available in this pure wire library or do this in a
  higher up library? favouring the higher-up library approach, but documenting
  this here so I do not forget this.

- I need to be sure that a broken PDU gets an appropriate response, this should
  be tested in a higher level library though, not in here
